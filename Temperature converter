# Getting the different inputs: 'fromMSG' is the first temp measurement, 'Inte' is the second one defining how much of the first measurement, and it starts with int() to show that is is an integer. The last input is exactly like the first input, exept for the fact that it is the measurement that you want to transfer to
fromMSG = input("Enter the first temp measurement: ")
Inte = int(input("Enter the first temp amount: "))
toMSG = input("Enter the second temp measurement: ")

        print("that is the SAME degree type!")

            # This message is a bit confusing, so I will break it up. First of all, we begin with a kind message, "alright!". Then, the amount of the measurement, str(Inte). This is a good time to say that in these messages, EVERYTHING needs to be eventually string, so I'll use str(x). Then, I'll mention what measurement was I talking about with "in" + toMSG. Here is the confusing part - str(float((float(Inte) - 273.15))). First, everything is a string, so float((float(Inte) - 273.15)) is the math problem. We are converting Kelvin to Celsius, to we want to keep things as "float" (not a full number). ((float(Inte) - 273.15) This is the final thing. So - the float value of the amount of degrees, minus 273.15 (the formula is online). That is it! I will not explain these in the rest of the formulas, because they are a copy of this, just with a different formula

            print("Alright! " + str(Inte) + " in " + fromMSG + " is " + str(float(float(Inte) - 273.15) * 1.8 + 32.0) + " in " + toMSG)

# Code example ('O' is output and 'I' is input) -

# O: Enter first temp measurement:

# I: kelvin

# O: Enter the first temp amount:

# I: 12

# O: Enter the second temp measurement:

# I: Celsius

# O: Alright! 12 in kelvin is -261.15 in Celsius
