# Once the while loop had ended, meaning, once the password is full, we do these things:

x = ""

# Just like 's', but now we can modify it with 'x'

        # Then, the amount of guesses is up by 1, because, after all, it was a guess
        # Then we add 'x' to our 'finale' string
        # Then we remove the first letter/number/symbol of 'listOfPass', so if the password list was ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"], now it is ["e", "l", "l", "o"], with list.pop(n)

# Once we are done, meaning the entire password is inside of 'finale' and the amount of guesses is inside of 'amount', we print the following message:
